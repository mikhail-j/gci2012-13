=Create SoaS F17 LiveUSB for Windows=
This is a guide on LiveUSB with SoaS (Sugar on a Stick).
<br>
==Getting Started==
Live-USB Creator for Windows ([https://fedorahosted.org/releases/l/i/liveusb-creator/liveusb-creator-3.11.7-setup.exe here])<br>
Sugar LiveCD/USB .ISO files (http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick/Downloads here)<br>
Please prepare a hard drive ('''''Backup any important data!''''') for SoaS, the <b>liveinst</b> will probably format the entire hard drive.<br>
USB flash drive (2GB+ free and backup any important data)<br>
<br><br>
===Installing Live-USB Creator===
Open "liveusb-creator-3.11.7-setup.exe", it should open to a new window.

<br><br>
The installation size (not the .ISO file) only needs 28MB, if the "Space Available:" is less than 600 MB and you haven't downloaded one of the .ISO files, please consider freeing some space on your hard drive. Then click the "Install" button.
<br><br>

<br><br>
After the installer tries to create a shortcut, a new window should popup. Click the "Yes" button.
<br><br>
By now, the following window should popup. Click the "Browse" button to look for the .ISO file you've recently downloaded.

<br><br>
Since the version I downloaded was i686, I'm going to select "Fedora-17-i686-Live-SoaS.iso" and click the "Open" button.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Make sure you selected the right .iso file, the window should now say "*filename* selected".

<br><br>
Click on your "Target Device" to check whether you've selected the corresponding Drive Letter ("F:") or name ("NEW VOLUME") for the USB flash drive and make sure you've made a '''''copy of any important files that maybe on that USB flash drive'''''. Then click the "Create Live USB" button.
<br>
'''''If your "Persistent Storage" slider can't be moved. Check if your USB flash drive has more than 1.8GB or it will fail.'''''<br><br>

===Running SoaS (LiveUSB) on your computer===
Make sure that you've turned off your computer (any hard drive that needs to be swapped should be swapped), you have to boot into the USB through the boot menu (you should see an option when you turn the computer on).
<br><br>
You should now see the following boot screen.
