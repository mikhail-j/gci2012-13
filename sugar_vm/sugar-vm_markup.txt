This is a guide to setup Sugar as a VM on your computer.
<br>
==Getting Started==
VMware Player ([https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/5_0 here])
Sugar LiveCD/USB (http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_on_a_Stick/Downloads here)
<br />VirtualBox Instructions (not yet complete).
<br>
==VMware Player==
===Running your VM for the first time===
Please install VMware Player ([https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/5_0 here]) first.
<br><br>
Then run VMware Player for the first time.

You are free to rename Other to something different (I chose Sugar) and click the "Next >" button.

By default, VMware Player will try to make the disk size of the VM 8GB. If this seems to be too much for you, lower it and just make sure you have 4GB+ set for the disk size.

Click "Customize Hardware", we need to increase the memory.

Set the memory to 512MB+ (more than 512MB if your computer has memory to spare).
