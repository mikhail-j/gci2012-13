##Chapter 5. Networking Services##
Services built on top of the core networking functionality
are described here. They include, for example, the IEEE 802.11
subsystem and the ISDN subsystem. Additionally, networking pseudo
devices and their operation is described.  
  
##5.1. IEEE 802.11##
The net80211 layer provides functionality required by
wireless cards. It is located under sys/net80211.
The code is meant to be shared between FreeBSD and NetBSD and therefore
NetBSD-specific bits should be attempted to be kept in the source file
ieee80211\_netbsd.c (likewise, there is ieee80211\_freebsd.c in FreeBSD).  
  
The ieee80211 interfaces are documented in Chapter
9 of the NetBSD manual pages. This document does not attempt
to duplicate information already available there.  
  
The responsibilities of the net80211 layer are the following:  


* MAC address based access control
* crypto
* input and output frame handling
* node management
* radiotap framework for bpf/tcpdump
* rate adaption
* supplementary routines such a kernel diagnostic output, conversion functions and resource management


The ieee80211 layer positions itself logically between
the device driver and the ethernet module, although for
transmission it is called indirectly by the device driver instead
of control passing straight through it. For input, the ieee80211
layer receives packets from the device driver, strips any
information useful only to wireless devices and in case of data
payload proceeds to hand the Ethernet frame up to
**ether_input**.  
  
###5.1.1. Device Management###
The way to describe an ieee80211 device to the ieee80211 layer
is by using a struct ieee80211com, declared
in sys/net80211/ieee80211_var.h.
It is used to register a device to the ieee80211 from the
device driver by calling **ieee80211_ifattach**.
Fields to be filled out by the caller include the
underlying struct ifnet pointer, function
callbacks and device capability flags. If a device is detached,
the ieee80211 layer can be notified with the call **ieee80211_ifdetach**.  
  
###5.1.2. Nodes###
A node represents another entity in the wireless network.
It is usually a base station when operating in BSS mode, but can
also represent entities in an ad-hoc network. A node is described
by struct ieee80211\_node, declared in sys/net80211/ieee80211\_node.h. Examples
of fields contained in the structure include the node unicast
encryption key, current transmit power, the negotiated rate set
and various statistics.  
  
A list of all the nodes seen by a certain device is
kept in the struct ieee80211com instance in the field ic_sta and
can be manipulated with the helper functions provided in
sys/net80211/ieee80211_node.c. The functions include, for example, methods to scan for
nodes, iterate through the nodelist and functionality
for maintaining the network structure.  
  
###5.1.3. Crypto Support###
Crypto support enables the encryption and decryption of
the network frames. It provides a framework for multiple
encryption methods such as WEP and null crypto. Crypto keys
are mostly managed through the ioctl interface and inside
the ieee80211 layer, and the only time drivers need to worry
about them is in the send routine when they must test for
an encapsulation requirement and call
**ieee80211\_crypto\_encap** if necessary.  
  
##ISDN##
The ISDN kernel subsystem found under the directory
sys/netisdn was originally developed as a
separate package called ISDN4BSD. It was integrated into
NetBSD for the NetBSD 1.6 release and some minor architectural
changes were made.  
  
The entire subsystem consists both of a kernel part and
a userspace part (**isdnd** being the main
element) with much of the operating logic spread between them.
Communication is accomplished through various device nodes,
/dev/isdn\*, but the control state is somewhat spread between both parties.  
  
The netisdn architecture is usually described as four layers:  


1. Layer 1 consists of the physical ISDN card hardware.
From the software perspective, support means a device driver.  
  

2. Layer 2 implements the Link Access Protocol Channel D
(LAPD), which is the link layer protocol used in ISDN.
The protocol used here is described by ITU-T document
series Q.92x.  
  

3. Layer 3 is the networking layer of ISDN, which takes care
of call setup and termination. It is described by the
ITU-T series Q.93x.  
  

4. Layer 4 abstracts the interface to the protocol stack.  


The ISDN system can accommodate both "passive" and "active"
hardware. The difference between these two is that "active"
cards implement the ISDN protocols already in their firmware.
Therefore they do not need the software implementation of layers 2
and 3 provided as part of netisdn.  
  
Since layers 2 and 3 are well stabilized and the probability
of having to deal with them is quite low, only the device driver
interface and layer 4 are discussed here.  
  
Finally, some general terminology is described:  


####Table 5.1. netisdn terminology####
|name|description|
|controller|An ISDN card. The identifier is a number opaque outside the subsystem and is received at the time of attaching the device driver to the ISDN subsystem.|
|channel|The ISDN B channel identifier. These are numbered in the controller's local space, i.e. every controller has a channel 1 (known as CHAN_B1)|
|CDID|Call Descriptor ID. This is an opaque, unique identifier for a call.|


###5.2.1. Layer 1: Device Drivers###
A device driver must register itself for the netisdn code
to function.  This is done by calling
**isdn_attach_isdnif** and by specifying the
callback interface struct,
struct isdn_l3_driver_functions, filled
with the appropriate driver callbacks as a parameter.  This
call also informs the isdn subsystem is card a basic rate card
(2 B channels) or primary rate card (30 B channels).  After
this, if applicable (i.e. a passive card), Layer 2 must be
notified of a card attachment by calling
**isdn\_layer2\_status_ind**.  Finally, the
subsystem must be notified that the card is ready for action
by calling **isdn\_isdnif\_ready**.

Cards supporting the ISDN CAPI should not attach using
the above method. Instead, they should hook to the CAPI layer.
This is done by filling out the link structure
capi\_softc\_t and calling **capi\_ll\_attach**. Currently, detaching a
CAPI card is not possible, since **capi\_ll\_detach** detach is not implemented.  
  
###5.2.2. Layer 4: User Interface###
Interaction from userspace with the subsystem is done through
ioctl's. The actual implementations are spread over several files,
depending on the part of the subsystem to interface with.  
  
###5.2.2.1. I4B driver###
The device node /dev/isdn used
by the ISDN userspace part, **isdnd** is
backed by the kernel implementation in
sys/netisdn/i4b_i4bdrv.c. The ioctl
handler is the function **isdnioctl**.
The type of structure passed as the ioctl argument depends
on the ioctl command issued, and, for example, is
msg\_connect\_req\_t for the
**isdnd** issued dialout request I4B\_CONNECT\_REQ. The messages exchanged
between the kernel and **isdndn** are documented
on the isdnd(8) manual page.  
  
###5.2.2.2. ISDN Telephony###
The telephony driver is used for audio calls. It consists
of two different device nodes: /dev/isdntel\[n\]
and /dev/isdnteld\[n\] used as the telephony
device and the telephony dialout device, respectively. Requests
are handled in sys/netisdn/i4b_tel.c in the
function **isdntelioctl**. Further documentation
is available from the isdntel(8) and isdntel(4) manual pages.  
  
##5.3. IPSec##
IPSec is collection of security-related protocols: Authentication
Header (AH) and Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP). This section,
however, is TODO.  
  
##5.4. Networking pseudo-devices##
A networking pseudo-device does not have a physical
hardware component backing the device. Pseudo devices can be roughly
divided into two different categories: pseudo-devices which
behave like an interface and devices which are controlled
through a device node. An interface built on top of a
pseudo-device acts completely the same as an interface with
hardware backing the interface.  
  
Since there is no backing hardware involved, most of
these interfaces can be generated and destroyed dynamically at
runtime. Interfaces that can dynamically de/allocate themselves
known as cloning interfaces. They are created and destroyed
by the **ifconfig** tool by using **ifconfig
create** and **ifconfig destroy**,
respectively. Additionally, the interface names available for
cloning can be requested by **ifconfig -C**.  
  
The list of networking pseudo-devices with short descriptions
is presented below.  
  
####Table 5.2. Available networking pseudo-devices####

|pf|Packet Filter, pf(4). The packet filter is a traffic filter.|  
  
###5.4.1. Cloning devices###
In the distant past, the number of pseudo-device instances
for each device type was hardcoded into the kernel configuration
and fixed at compile-time. This, while the fastest method
for implementation, was wasteful because it allocated resources
based on a compile-decision and limiting because it required
recompilation when wanting to use the n+1'th device. Cloning
devices allow resource allocation and resource release
dynamically at runtime.  
  
This discussion will concentrate on cloning interfaces,
i.e. cloners which are created using **ifconfig**.  
  
Most of the work behind in cloning in interface is handled
in common code in net/if.c in the
**if_clone** family of functions. Cloning
interfaces are registered and deregistered using
**if\_clone\_attach** and **if\_clone\_detach**, respectively. These
calls are usually made in the pseudo-device attach and
detach routines. Both functions take as an argument a pointer
to the if_clone structure, which identifies the cloning interface.  
  
struct if\_clone is initialized by using the IF\_CLONE\_INITIALIZER macro:  
    struct if_clone cloner =
        IF_CLONE_INITIALIZER("clonername", cloner_create, cloner_destroy);

The parameters **cloner_create** and
**cloner_destroy** are pointers to functions
to be called from the common code.  Create is responsible
for allocating resources and attaching the interface to the
rest of the framework while destroy is responsible for the
opposite. Of course, destroy must preserve normal system
semantics and not remove resources which are still in use.
This is relevant with for example the tun device, where users
open the /dev/tun\[n\] when using tun interface n.  
  
A create or destroy operation coming from userspace
passes through **sys\_ioctl** and **soo\_ioctl** before landing at
**ifioctl**. The correct struct if\_clone is found by searching the names of the
attached cloners, i.e. doing string comparison. After this
the function pointers in the structure are used.  
  
###5.4.2. Pseudo Interface Operation###
The operation and attachment to the rest of the operating
system kernel for a pseudo device depend greatly on the device's
functionality. The following are some examples:  


* The vlan interface is always attached to a
parent device when operational. It sends packets by vlan
encapsulating them and enqueueing them onto the parent
device packet send queue. It receives packets from **ether_input**, removes the vlan
encapsulation and passes it back to the parent interface's **if_input** routine.  
  
* The gif interface registers itself as an interface to the
networking stack by using **if_attach** and
**gif_output** as the output routine. This
output routine is then called from the network layer output
routine, **ip_output** and the output
routine eventually calls **ip_output** again
once the packet has been encapsulated. Input is handled
by **in\_gif\_input**, which is called via
the struct protosw input routine
from the encapsulated packet input function.  
  
* The tap interface registers itself as a network interface
using **if_attach**. When a packet is
sent through it, it notifies the device node listener
or, if corresponding device is not open, simply drops
all packets. When a packet is written to the device node,
it gets injected into the networking stack through
the **if_input** routine in the associated struct ifnet.


##5.5. Packet Filters##
In principle there are three pseudo devices involved
with packet filtering. Out of these ipfilter and pf are
involved in filtering network traffic and bpf is an interface
to capture and access raw network traffic.  All will be
discussed briefly from the point of view of their attachment
to rest of the kernel; the packet inspection and modification
engines they implement are beyond the scope of this document.  
  
Out of these ipfilter and pf are implemented using
pfil hooks, while bpf is implemented as a tap in all the network drivers.  
  
###5.5.1. Packet Filter Interface###
pfil is a purely in-kernel interface to support packet
filtering hooks. Packet filters can register hooks which should
be called when packet processing taken place; in it's essence
pfil is a list of callbacks for certain events. In addition
to being able to register a filter for incoming and outgoing
packets, pfil provides support for interface attach/detach and
address change notifications. pfil is described on the pfil(9)
manual page and is used by IP Filter and Packet Filter (pf) to
hook to the packet stream for implementing firewalls and NAT.  
  
###5.5.3. IPFilter###
IP Filter, found in sys/dist/ipf/netinet,
is a multiplatform packet filtering device useful for
creating a firewall and Network Address Translation (NAT).
Operation is controlled through device nodes with userland tools.
IP Filter is documented on multiple different manual pages:
ipf(4), ipl(4), ipnat(4), ipf(5) and ipnat(5) are good starting points.  
  
IP Filter is attached to the system by enabling it with the
command line tool **ipf -E**. This causes the
ioctl SIOCFRENB to be executed and function
**iplattach** to be called. **iplattach** calls pfil routines to establish
a packet filter hook to check for packet delivery. The packet
filter hooks catch both incoming and outgoing packets and
call the IP Filter routine **fr_check**, which,
through various subroutine calls, decides if the packet should
be let in or out and applies necessary address translations for
NAT. Detachment is performed by removing the registered pfil
hooks to stop packet delivery to IP Filter.  
  
###5.5.3. pf###
pf, found in sys/dist/pf/net,
provides roughly the same functionality as ipfilter. Its
operation is also very similar. Some relevant manual pages
describing pf are pf(4), pf.conf(5) and pfctl(8).  
  
pf is started using the tool **pfctl**,
which issues a DIOCSTART ioctl.  This causes
pf to call **pf\_pfil\_attach**, which runs the
necessary pfil attachment routines. The key routines after
this are **pf\_test** and **pf\_test6**, which are called for IPv4
and IPv6 packets, respectively, to test should they be
allowed to be sent/received or dropped. The packet filter
hooks, and therefore the whole of pf, are disabled with
the DIOCSTOP ioctl, usually issued with **pfctl**.  
  
###5.5.4. Berkeley Packet Filter###
The Berkeley Packet Filter (bpf) (sys/net/bpf.c) provides link layer
access to data available on the network through interfaces
attached to the system.  bpf is used by opening a device
node, /dev/bpf and issuing **ioctl**'s to control the operation of
the device. A popular example of a tool using bpf is **tcpdump**.  
  
The device /dev/bpf is a cloning device, meaning it can be opened multiple times. 
It is in principle similar to a cloning interface, except bpf provides
no network interface, only a method to open the same device
multiple times.  
  
To capture network traffic, a bpf device must be attached
to an interface. The traffic on this interface is then passed
to bpf to evaluation. For attaching an interface to an open
bpf device, the ioctl BIOCSETIF is used.
The interface is identified by passing a struct ifreq, which contains the
interface name in ASCII encoding. This is used to find the
interface from the kernel tables. bpf
registers itself to the interfaces struct ifnet field if_bpf
to inform the system that it is interested about traffic on this particular interface.
The listener can also pass a set of filtering rules to capture
only certain packets, for example ones matching a given host and port
combination.  
  
bpf captures packets by supplying a tapping interface,
**bpf_tap**-functions, to link layer drivers
and relying on the drivers to always pass packets to it. Drivers
honor this request and commonly have code which, along both the
input and output paths, does:
    #if NBPFILTER > 0
                    if (ifp->if_bpf)
    	                    bpf_mtap(ifp->if_bpf, m0);
    #endif
This passes the mbuf to the bpf for inspection. bpf inspects
the data and decides is anyone listening to this particular
interface is interested in it. The filter inspecting the data
is highly optimized to minimize time spent inspecting each
packet. If the filter matches, the packet is copied to await
being read from the device.  
  
The bpf tapping feature looks very much like the
interfaces provided by pfil, so a valid is question is debating
the necessity of both. Even though they provide similar services,
their functionality is disjoint. The bpf mtap wants to access
packets right off the wire without any alteration and possibly
copy it for further use. Callers linking into pfil want to
modify and possibly drop packets.
