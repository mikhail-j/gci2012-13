##Appendix A. Acknowledgments##
##A.1. Authors##
* Julio Merino wrote most of [Chapter 2, 
File system internals](http://netbsd.org/docs/internals/en/chap-file-system.html)
and small bits of [Chapter 1, 
Memory management](http://netbsd.org/docs/internals/en/chap-memory.html). These chapters were the foundation of this book.  
  

* The initial versions of these chapters were written as
part of tmpfs' development, which was possible thanks to [Google](http://www.google.com/)'s
[Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html) 2005 program.  
  
Thanks also go to William Studenmund for reviewing [Chapter 2, 
File system internals](http://netbsd.org/docs/internals/en/chap-file-system.html) and providing multiple valuable suggestions.  
  
* Emmanuel Dreyfus wrote half of [Chapter 3, 
Processes and threads](http://netbsd.org/docs/internals/en/chap-processes.html). 
Daniel Sieger wrote [Section 3.6, 
“Thread scheduling”](http://netbsd.org/docs/internals/en/chap-processes.html#scheduling).  
  
* Antti Kantee wrote [Chapter 4, 
Networking](http://netbsd.org/docs/internals/en/chap-networking-core.html)
and [Chapter 5, 
Networking Services](http://netbsd.org/docs/internals/en/chap-networking-services.html), but was kind
enough to leave room for future contributions on the subject.
